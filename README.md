This is my code of the way to ACM-ICPC!

The code is used to solve some problems of UVa Online Judge, especially Rujia
Liu's problems. Most problems can be found and explained in Rujia Liu's two
books, AOAPC Beginning Algorithm Contests and AOAPC Beginning Algorithm
Contests Training Guide.

The ACM-ICPC and the two books are a great help to my programming capability
and my road of the programmer, so I should thank ACM-ICPC and Rujia Liu.

HINT: The solutions of most problems can be found in [wiki](https://github.com/windalex/ACM-ICPC/wiki).
